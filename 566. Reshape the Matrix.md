# 566. Reshape the Matrix
In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size
but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number 
and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they
were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output 
the original matrix.

**Example**
```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

**Example**
```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
```

# Solution
**Java**
```
public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
    int n = nums.length, m = nums[0].length;
    if (r*c != n*m) return nums;
    int[][] res = new int[r][c];
    for (int i=0;i<r*c;i++) 
        res[i/c][i%c] = nums[i/m][i%m];
    return res;
}
```

**Python**
```
def matrixReshape(self, A, nR, nC):
    if len(A) * len(A[0]) != nR * nC:
        return A
        
    vals = (val for row in A for val in row)
    return [[vals.next() for c in xrange(nC)] for r in xrange(nR)]
```
