# Employee Importance   
You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's unique id, his importance value and 
his direct subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2 is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 
15, 10 and 5, respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]], and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and
employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the relationship is not direct.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id, you need to return the total importance value of this 
employee and all his subordinates.

**Example**
```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

**C++**
```
/*
// Employee info
class Employee {
public:
    // It's the unique ID of each node.
    // unique id of this employee
    int id;
    // the importance value of this employee
    int importance;
    // the id of direct subordinates
    vector<int> subordinates;
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int getImportance(vector<Employee*> employees, int id) {     
        int sum = 0;
        if(employees.size() == 0)
            return sum;
        map<int,Employee*>Tree;
        for(auto c: employees)
            Tree[c->id] = c;
        queue<int>Res;
        Res.push(id);
        while(!Res.empty())
        {
            int Node = Res.front();
            Res.pop();
            for(auto c : Tree[Node]->subordinates)
                Res.push(c);
            sum += Tree[Node]->importance;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
