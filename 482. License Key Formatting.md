# 482. License Key Formatting
You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is 
separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.

Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the
first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash
inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.

**Example1**
```
Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

# Solution
**Java**
```
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            if (s.charAt(i) != '-')
                sb.append(sb.length() % (k + 1) == k ? '-' : "").append(s.charAt(i));
        return sb.reverse().toString().toUpperCase();
    } 
```

**Python**
```
class Solution(object):
    def licenseKeyFormatting(self, S, K):
        """
        :type S: str
        :type K: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        S = S.upper().replace('-','')
        size = len(S)
        s1 = K if size%K==0 else size%K
        res = S[:s1]
        while s1<size:
            res += '-'+S[s1:s1+K]
            s1 += K
        return res
```

**C++**
```
    string licenseKeyFormatting(string S, int K) {
      string res;
      for (auto i = S.rbegin(); i < S.rend(); i++)
        if (*i != '-') (res.size()%(K+1)-K? res : res+='-') += toupper(*i);
      return reverse(res.begin(), res.end()), res;
    }
```
